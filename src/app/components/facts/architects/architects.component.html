                      Most profssional architects are worth the imeÂ±ment. they<br>
                      are very good at designing indMiduaI client requirements.<br>
                      personalised scope of works, a schedule of finishes and<br>
                      detailed specifcations.<br>
                      This is what we as professional builders need to allcnv us to<br>
                      prcvide accurate pricing in advance which minimises changes<br>
                      and<br>
                      Architects are neither builders nor estimators.<br>
                      They can only give you a guide using historical prices for<br>
                      their designs. ONLY f the project is recent and very similar<br>
                      Trust your professional builder to provide accurate pricing<br>
                      with backup data alternative selections if available.<br>
